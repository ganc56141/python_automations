Intro: Manually making a network 
'''

#G = nx.Graph() # Makes an empty (undirected) network
G = nx.DiGraph()    # Makes an empty directed network
G.add_node(0)
G.add_node(1)

# Let's make a star network
for i in range(1, 10):
    G.add_edge(0, i)    # Adds an edge between 0 and node i. Automatically creates node i if it doesn't already exist
nx.draw(G, with_labels = True)
#plt.show()

''' 
Basic functions for analyzing your network
'''

N = len(G)  # returns number of nodes in G
G.has_edge(0,1) # Returns true
G.has_edge(1, 0) # returns false because G is directed and only has 0-->1, not 1-->0
nx.has_path(G, 0, 1) # returns true because there's a path from 0 to 1
nx.shortest_path(G, 0,1) # returns list of nodes in the shortest path from 0 to 1
print(G.degree()) # returns dictionary where keys are the nodes and values are the degrees
G.degree()[0]   # Degree of node 0

'''
Reading in network data from an edge list
Example: Russian trade network.
'''

file = open("russiantrade_edges.txt", "r")  # saves the file
lines = file.read().splitlines()    # Reads in the file line by line, saves each line as an element in a list

# L.split('\t') splits line L every time it sees \t and stores each piece in a list. 
# It returns a list with two elements, the source node and target node.
sources = [int(L.split('\t')[0]) for L in lines]
targets = [int(L.split('\t')[1]) for L in lines]

# Make the network
G = nx.Graph()
E = len(sources)    # Number of edges
for i in range(E):
    G.add_edge(sources[i], targets[i])

# Draw the network.
nx.draw(G, with_labels = True)
#plt.show()

# Better visualization. (Can make a bigger difference with larger networks.)
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)   # Uses Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm to find "optimal" node positions
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels = True)
plt.show()

'''
Reading in network data from an adjacency matrix stored as csv file
Example: Paul Revere network. Nodes are individuals associated with P. Revere's ride.
Edges are number of organizations that both nodes are affiliated with. 
(Projection from a bipartite network.)

print(df) # notice the column names are 1, ...., ncols-1
col_names = {i : i-1 for i in range(1, ncols)}  # Column names must match column indices (It's what networkx wants, I don't know why.)

# Visualize the network

Reading in network data from gexf file

plus teachers. There are edges between nodes that have contact with each other.
